## Sample Real Data

### Example Word (A1 - "no")

```json
{
  "word": "no",
  "level": "A1",
  "difficulty": 1,
  "definition": "A negating expression; an answer that shows disagreement",
  "phonetic": "/nəʊ/",
  "audioUrl": "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/media/pronunciations/en/no-uk.mp3",
  "meanings": [
    {
      "partOfSpeech": "noun",
      "definitions": [
        {
          "definition": "A negating expression...",
          "synonyms": ["nay", "nope"],
          "antonyms": ["aye", "yea", "yes"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Word (B1 - "knowledge")

```json
{
  "word": "knowledge",
  "level": "B1",
  "difficulty": 4,
  "definition": "The fact of knowing about something; general understanding",
  "phonetic": "/ˈnɒlɪdʒ/",
  "audioUrl": "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/media/pronunciations/en/knowledge-uk.mp3"
}
```

## 🎯 Launch Instructions

### Backend (Already Running)

```bash
# Backend API running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
# Database seeded with 60 real words
# All endpoints operational
```

### Frontend

#### If NOT running, start it:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5173
```

#### If already running:

- Just refresh the browser to see real data! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. Test Level Selection

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

- Should show 6 levels (A1-C2)
- A1, A2, B1 have 20 words each
- Click "Start Training" on A1, A2, or B1

### 2. Test Word Training

```
http://localhost:5173/training/A1
```

- Should display real word with definition
- Audio pronunciation available (click "Pronounce")
- "Spell Out" button works
- Click "+ Add to Learn" → Auto-advances to next word!
- Click "Next Word →" for new random word

### 3. Test Saved Words

```
http://localhost:5173/vocabulary
```

- Shows all words you saved
- Can start quizzes, image matching, listening, writing
- Progress statistics display

### 4. Test Quiz Modes

```
http://localhost:5173/vocabulary/quiz
```

- Multiple choice questions from your saved words
- Tracks correct/incorrect answers
- Updates spaced repetition schedule

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Higher Levels (B2, C1, C2)

**Issue**: Free Dictionary API doesn't have all advanced words

**Workaround Options**:

1. **Use A1, A2, B1 for now** (60 words total)
2. **Add simpler B2/C1/C2 words** to seeder:

   ```php
   // In WordSeeder.php, replace complex words with simpler ones
   'B2' => ['analyze', 'create', 'develop', 'establish'...]
   ```

3. **Use on-demand fetching**:

   - App will try to fetch missing words automatically
   - Some words may not be found

4. **Wait for cache expiry** (7 days):
   - After 7 days, failed words will be retried
   - Or manually clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### API Caching

- **First fetch**: ~500ms per word
- **Cached fetch**: <1ms (7-day cache)
- **Cache hit rate**: Expected 99%+ after initial seed

### Database Stats

```
Total words: 60
├── A1: 20 words (hello, goodbye, cat, dog, book...)
├── A2: 20 words (weather, travel, hotel, beautiful...)
└── B1: 20 words (environment, technology, culture...)
```

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

### What You Can Do Now

---

**Note**: For production with all 6 levels (120 words), consider:

1. Using simpler words for B2/C1/C2 that Free API has
2. Or integrate Merriam-Webster API (requires key but has all words)
3. Or manually curate word lists for higher levels

For now, enjoy **60 real dictionary words** ready to practice! 🚀
