# 🎉 Progress Page Improvements

## ✨ What's Been Fixed and Enhanced

All three requested improvements have been successfully implemented!

## 1. ✅ Light Theme Icon Changed

**Location**: Navigation bar theme toggle button

**Before**: Moon icon (filled) in light mode  
**After**: Sun icon (outlined) in light mode

**Changes**:
- Changed from filled moon icon to outlined sun icon
- Better visual representation of light mode
- More consistent with modern UI patterns
- Icon color changed to `text-purple-600` for better visibility

**File**: `frontend/src/App.vue`

```vue
<!-- Light mode icon (sun) -->
<svg
  v-else
  class="w-5 h-5 text-purple-600"
  fill="none"
  stroke="currentColor"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
>
  <path
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    stroke-width="2"
    d="M12 3v1m0 16v1m9-9h-1M4 12H3m15.364 6.364l-.707-.707M6.343 6.343l-.707-.707m12.728 0l-.707.707M6.343 17.657l-.707.707M16 12a4 4 0 11-8 0 4 4 0 018 0z"
  />

## 3. ✅ Progress by Level Block Fixed

**Location**: Progress page - "Progress by Level" section at bottom

### Problems Fixed:

1. **Division by zero issue**: 
   - Previously: `total || 1` could show incorrect percentages
   - Now: Only shows levels that actually have words

2. **Empty state handling**:
   - Previously: Showed all 6 levels even with no data
   - Now: Only shows levels with words OR shows empty state

3. **Better user experience**:
   - Cleaner display
   - No misleading progress bars
   - Clear message when no progress

### New Behavior:

**When you have words**:
- ✅ Shows only levels with words (e.g., A1, A2, B1)
- ✅ Accurate progress bars
- ✅ Correct mastered/total counts

**When you have no words**:
- ✅ Shows empty state with icon
- ✅ Clear message: "No progress yet"
- ✅ Helpful hint: "Start learning words to see your progress by level"

**File**: `frontend/src/views/Progress.vue`

## 🎨 Technical Implementation

### New Computed Properties:

```javascript
// Only show levels that have words
const activeLevels = computed(() => {
  const allLevels = ['A1', 'A2', 'B1', 'B2', 'C1', 'C2'];
  return allLevels.filter(level => {
    const progress = levelProgress.value[level];
    return progress && progress.total > 0;
  });
});

// Check if any levels have progress
const hasAnyLevelProgress = computed(() => activeLevels.value.length > 0);
```

### New Methods:

```javascript
// Show all words in modal
const showAllWordsModal = async () => {
  modalTitle.value = 'All Your Words';
  await userWordsStore.fetchUserWords();
  modalWords.value = userWordsStore.words || [];
  showModal.value = true;
};

// Show only mastered words in modal
const showMasteredWordsModal = async () => {
  modalTitle.value = 'Mastered Words';
  await userWordsStore.fetchUserWords();
  modalWords.value = (userWordsStore.words || []).filter(
    word => word.status === 'mastered'
  );
  showModal.value = true;
};

// Close modal
const closeModal = () => {
  showModal.value = false;
  modalWords.value = [];
};

// Navigate to vocabulary page
const goToVocabulary = () => {
  closeModal();
  router.push('/vocabulary');
};
```

### Modal State:

```javascript
const showModal = ref(false);
const modalTitle = ref('');
const modalWords = ref([]);
```
