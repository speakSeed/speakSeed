# 🎯 Training Page - Show Only New Words

## ✨ Feature Implemented

**Training pages now only show new words that haven't been added to "My Dictionary"!**

This ensures users don't see duplicate words they've already saved, providing a better learning experience.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:

- ❌ Training showed random words from the level
- ❌ Could show the same word multiple times
- ❌ Would show words already in "My Dictionary"
- ❌ No way to know how many new words remained
- ❌ Confusing when "Add to Learn" button was already clicked

### After:

- ✅ Training shows ONLY new words (not in dictionary)
- ✅ Never shows duplicate words
- ✅ Automatically filters out saved words
- ✅ Shows count of remaining new words
- ✅ Beautiful success screen when all words are saved
- ✅ Smart batching for better performance

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Word Filtering System**

**New Computed Property:**

```typescript
const savedWordIds = computed(() => {
  return new Set(userWordsStore.words.map((w: any) => w.wordId));
});
```

**Filtering Function:**

```typescript
const getUnsavedWords = (words: Word[]): Word[] => {
  return words.filter((word) => !savedWordIds.value.has(word.id));
};
```

### 2. **Batch Loading**

Instead of loading one word at a time, we now:

1. Load a batch of 50 words from the API
2. Filter out already-saved words
3. Shuffle the remaining words
4. Show them one by one

**Benefits:**

- ⚡ Faster performance (fewer API calls)
- 🎯 Better user experience (no waiting between words)
- 🔄 Efficient memory usage

### 3. **Smart Word Pool Management**

```typescript
const loadAvailableWords = async () => {
  // Fetch batch of words
  const response = await wordApi.getByLevel(currentLevel.value, 50);
  const allWords = response.data || [];

  // Filter out already saved words
  availableWords.value = getUnsavedWords(allWords);

  // Shuffle for variety
  availableWords.value = availableWords.value.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);

  // Set first word
  wordsStore.currentWord = availableWords.value[0];
};
```

### 4. **Dynamic Word Removal**

When a word is added to dictionary:

```typescript
// Remove from available pool immediately
availableWords.value = availableWords.value.filter(
  (w) => w.id !== currentWordId
);
```

This ensures the word won't appear again in the current session.

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### 1. **Header Shows Remaining Words**

**Before:** "Words learned: 5"  
**After:** "**12** new words available"

- Shows count of unsaved words
- Highlighted in purple
- Updates in real-time

### 2. **Success State - All Words Saved**

When all words in a level are saved, users see:

```
🎉 Congratulations!

All words in this level have been added to your dictionary!

[Choose Another Level]  [My Dictionary]
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Green checkmark icon (20x20)
- 🎉 Celebration message
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient buttons
- 🔗 Quick navigation options

### 3. **Loading Messages**

- "Loading word..." (while fetching)
- Better error handling
- Smooth transitions

## 📊 Algorithm Flow

```
1. User enters training page
   ↓
2. Fetch user's saved words from API
   ↓
3. Fetch 50 words for the level
   ↓
4. Filter: Keep only words NOT in saved list
   ↓
5. Shuffle remaining words
   ↓
6. Show first word
   ↓
7. User clicks "Next" → Show next from pool
   ↓
8. User clicks "Add to Learn"
   ↓
9. Save word to API
   ↓
10. Remove word from available pool
   ↓
11. Auto-advance to next word
   ↓
12. If pool empty → Fetch new batch
   ↓
13. If no unsaved words → Show success
```

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start

```
1. User selects "A1" level (20 words available)
2. Header shows: "20 new words available"
3. First word appears
4. User clicks "Add to Learn"
5. Header updates: "19 new words available"
6. Next word auto-appears
7. Continues until 0 words remaining
8. Success screen appears
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Progress

```
1. User has already saved 10/20 words
2. Returns to training
3. Header shows: "10 new words available"
4. Only shows the 10 unsaved words
5. Never shows the 10 already saved
```

### Scenario 3: All Words Saved

```
1. User has saved all 20/20 words
2. Clicks level again
3. Header shows: "0 new words available"
4. Success screen appears immediately
